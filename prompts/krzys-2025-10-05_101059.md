User Prompt:
When I click an announcement (/announcements/5) it loads indefinitely unless I change accessibility settings. Fix it.

Assistant Response:
Added ChangeDetectorRef usage and a 15s safety timeout in AnnouncementDetailsComponent to prevent permanent loading spinner if observable never resolves. MarkForCheck invoked on success/error and after marking as read to ensure UI updates under possible zoneless or OnPush scenario. If issue persists root cause may be stalled HTTP (CORS/auth) â€” next step would be logging network errors or adding retry/backoff.
