Assistant Response:
Full test suite executed with dotnet test --no-build. Results: 353 total tests, 0 failed, 0 skipped, duration 45.2s. Integration project reports deterministic seeding with announcements skipped (env flag). No further code changes required. Repository state: green. Next optional improvements (not applied now):
- Add lightweight seed verification test asserting admin user and zero announcements when SKIP_SEED_ANNOUNCEMENTS true.
- Standardize projection expressions across services (Messages, Reports) for consistency.
- Introduce test category filters for faster targeted runs in CI (e.g., Trait attributes).
- Capture seeding performance metrics to track future optimizations.

Completion Summary: All tests passing; no modifications made beyond recording this prompt per process requirements.
