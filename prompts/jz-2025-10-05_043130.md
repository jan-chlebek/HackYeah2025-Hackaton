# Prompt: Create Unit Tests for Entity API

**Branch**: jz  
**Timestamp**: 2025-10-05 04:31:30  
**User Request**: "run unit tests for entities api"

## Context

The user requested to run unit tests for the entities API, but tests didn't exist yet. The agent discovered this and proceeded to create comprehensive unit tests for the `EntitiesController`.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created EntitiesControllerTests.cs

Created a comprehensive test file with 21 test methods covering all 6 endpoints of the `EntitiesController`:

**File**: `backend/UknfCommunicationPlatform.Tests.Unit/Controllers/EntitiesControllerTests.cs`

**Test Structure**:
- Used InMemoryDatabase with unique GUID for database isolation
- Mocked `ILogger<EntitiesController>` for dependency injection
- Created `EntityManagementService` instance with test database
- Implemented `IDisposable` pattern with `EnsureDeleted()` for cleanup
- Used xUnit `[Fact]` attributes with FluentAssertions for assertions

**Seed Data**: 5 test entities covering different types:
- Test Bank 1 (active, complete data)
- Test Insurance Company (active)
- Inactive Bank (soft deleted)
- Test Investment Fund (active, cross-border)
- Another Test Bank (active)

### 2. Test Coverage by Endpoint

#### GetEntities (7 tests):
- ✅ Returns all entities when no filters applied
- ✅ Returns paginated results with correct page size
- ✅ Filters by entity type (e.g., "Bank")
- ✅ Filters by active status (isActive=true)
- ✅ Searches in Name, NIP, REGON, KRS fields
- ✅ Defaults to page 1 when page < 1
- ✅ Handles invalid page size correctly

#### GetEntity (2 tests):
- ✅ Returns entity when exists
- ✅ Returns NotFound when doesn't exist

#### CreateEntity (3 tests):
- ✅ Creates entity successfully with all required fields
- ✅ Returns CreatedAtAction with correct route
- ✅ Returns BadRequest when NIP already exists

#### UpdateEntity (2 tests):
- ✅ Updates entity successfully with all required fields
- ✅ Returns NotFound when entity doesn't exist

#### DeleteEntity (3 tests):
- ✅ Soft deletes entity (sets IsActive=false)
- ✅ Returns NotFound when entity doesn't exist
- ✅ Doesn't affect other entities

#### GetEntityUsers (1 test):
- ✅ Returns empty list when no users exist

#### Integration Tests (3 tests):
- ✅ Full CRUD workflow works correctly
- ✅ Pagination calculates total pages correctly
- ✅ Combined filters work correctly (type + status)

### 3. Issues Encountered and Fixed

#### Issue 1: Constructor Parameters
**Error**: `EntityManagementService` doesn't take 2 arguments  
**Fix**: Removed `ILogger<EntityManagementService>` from constructor (service only takes `ApplicationDbContext`)

#### Issue 2: Missing Using Statement
**Error**: `UserListItemResponse` not found  
**Fix**: Added `using UknfCommunicationPlatform.Core.DTOs.Users;`

#### Issue 3: Missing Required Fields
**Error**: Required properties missing for `SupervisedEntity`  
**Required Fields**: `BuildingNumber`, `City`, `Email`, `PostalCode`, `Street`  
**Fix**: Added all required fields to test requests and seed data

#### Issue 4: Auto-Generated UKNF Code
**Error**: Expected `UknfCode` to be "BANK999" but got "UKNF000001"  
**Behavior**: System auto-generates UKNF codes in format "UKNF{6-digit-number}"  
**Fix**: Changed test to expect `UknfCode.Should().StartWith("UKNF")`

#### Issue 5: Soft Delete Behavior
**Error**: Expected entity to be null after delete, but it still exists  
**Behavior**: Delete is soft delete (sets `IsActive=false`), not hard delete  
**Fix**: Changed tests to verify `IsActive=false` instead of null, and count stays same

#### Issue 6: NIP Uniqueness Conflict
**Error**: Update test failed with BadRequest  
**Cause**: Test tried to update entity 1 with NIP "1111111111" which entity 4 already has  
**Fix**: Changed update test to use unique NIP "9999999999"

### 4. Test Results

**Final Results**:
```
Passed!  - Failed:     0, Passed:    21, Skipped:     0
```

**All Backend Tests**:
```
Unit Tests:        185 passed (includes 21 new entity tests)
Integration Tests:  20 passed
Total:             205 passed, 0 failed
```

### 5. Key Learnings

1. **System-Generated Codes**: `UknfCode` is auto-generated by the system, not from user input
2. **Soft Delete Pattern**: Delete operations set `IsActive=false` rather than removing records
3. **Required Fields**: SupervisedEntity has 5 required fields (Street, BuildingNumber, City, PostalCode, Email)
4. **Unique Constraints**: NIP and REGON must be unique across entities
5. **Update Semantics**: `UpdateEntityRequest` allows nullable fields but service sets them directly

### 6. Test Patterns Used

- **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Clear structure in all tests
- **InMemoryDatabase**: Isolated test database per test class instance
- **FluentAssertions**: Readable assertions with `.Should()` syntax
- **xUnit Facts**: Simple test methods without theory parameters
- **Test Regions**: Organized tests by endpoint with `#region` comments

## Files Modified

1. `backend/UknfCommunicationPlatform.Tests.Unit/Controllers/EntitiesControllerTests.cs` - **CREATED** (607 lines)

## Test Statistics

- **Total Tests**: 21
- **Lines of Code**: 607
- **Test Coverage**:
  - GetEntities: 7 tests (pagination, filtering, search)
  - GetEntity: 2 tests (found, not found)
  - CreateEntity: 3 tests (success, route, duplicate)
  - UpdateEntity: 2 tests (success, not found)
  - DeleteEntity: 3 tests (soft delete, not found, no side effects)
  - GetEntityUsers: 1 test (empty list)
  - Integration: 3 tests (workflow, pagination, combined filters)

## Warnings Addressed

The compilation produced 9 nullable reference warnings (CS8602) which are expected and safe:
- They occur when accessing properties via reflection in dynamic response objects
- FluentAssertions performs runtime checks before dereferencing
- No actual null reference exceptions occur at runtime

## Next Steps

The entity API tests are complete and passing. Potential future enhancements:
- Add test for `ImportEntities` endpoint when implemented (Sprint 3)
- Add tests with actual user relationships for `GetEntityUsers`
- Add tests for entity search across all identifier fields
- Add boundary tests for pagination limits
