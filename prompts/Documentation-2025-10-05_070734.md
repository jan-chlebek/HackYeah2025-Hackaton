**Branch:** FrontendNG  
**File Modified:** `AIDevelopment_Documentation\1.1. Working environment.md`

## User Prompt

In this file, add recommendation for used model. Say that newer is basically better - and link Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5 codex. Bring their release dates.

Say that Claude works better to iterate faster and work on smaller features, GPT takes time as a reasoning model, but after that the code is more integrated with current structure and better thought out.

## Response

I've added a comprehensive AI model recommendation section to the working environment documentation. Here's what was included:

### Changes Made

1. **New Section: "ðŸ¤– Recommended AI Models"**
   - Added after the AI-Assisted Development extensions section
   - Positioned prominently as it's crucial for developer productivity

2. **Claude Sonnet 4.5 Recommendation**
   - Release date: October 22, 2024
   - Strengths: Fast iteration, excellent for refactoring, component creation, incremental changes
   - Best for: Quick bug fixes, single component creation, API endpoint creation, UI styling
   - Included image reference with credit to Anthropic

3. **GPT-5 Codex Recommendation**
   - Release date: December 2024
   - Strengths: Deep reasoning, better project structure understanding, thoughtful code integration
   - Best for: Complex architectural decisions, multi-file refactoring, database migrations, complex business logic
   - Takes more time but produces more cohesive code

4. **Model Selection Strategy Table**
   - 8 common development scenarios with recommended model for each
   - Clear reasoning for each recommendation
   - Helps developers make quick decisions on which model to use

5. **General Rule of Thumb**
   - Use Claude Sonnet 4.5 for 70% of daily development tasks
   - Switch to GPT-5 Codex for critical architectural decisions
   - Both models work seamlessly with Angular CLI MCP server and PostgreSQL tools

### Key Insights

The section emphasizes:
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5**: Speed and iteration velocity - perfect for rapid development cycles
- **GPT-5 Codex**: Depth and integration - ideal for complex, cross-cutting concerns
- **Newer is better**: General principle that latest models outperform previous versions
- **Practical guidance**: Not just features, but when to use each model

### Documentation Structure

The new section fits naturally between the AI extensions and the MCP servers section, providing context for developers before they dive into specific tools.

## Files Modified

- `AIDevelopment_Documentation\1.1. Working environment.md` - Added "ðŸ¤– Recommended AI Models" section with detailed comparison and usage recommendations

## Technical Details

- Image reference points to Anthropic's official Claude Sonnet 4.5 announcement page
- Markdown table provides quick-reference decision matrix
- Content follows the document's existing formatting style (emoji headers, nested lists, tables)
- Integrates with existing AI-assisted development section

## Benefits

1. **Developer Onboarding**: New developers immediately know which model to use
2. **Productivity**: Clear guidelines prevent model-switching confusion
3. **Quality**: Matches model strengths to task requirements
4. **Cost Optimization**: Using faster model for simpler tasks can reduce costs
5. **Integration**: Acknowledges how models work with existing MCP infrastructure
