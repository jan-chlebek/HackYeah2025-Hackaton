## User Request

We were testing backend with endpoint http://localhost:5000/health and response was just Healthy

## AI Response

I've updated the documentation to reflect the actual health endpoint implementation used in your project. The changes include:

### Updates Made:

**1. Health Endpoint Path:**
- Changed from `/api/health` to `/health` (matching your actual implementation)

**2. Response Format:**
- Primary example now shows the simple string response: `"Healthy"`
- Added alternative detailed JSON response as optional enhancement

**3. Code Example:**
```csharp
// Simple version (what you're using)
app.MapGet("/health", () => "Healthy")
.WithName("HealthCheck")
.WithTags("System");

// Alternative detailed version
app.MapGet("/health", () => Results.Ok(new 
{
    Status = "Healthy",
    Timestamp = DateTime.UtcNow,
    Version = "1.0.0"
}))
```

**4. Test URL:**
- Updated from `https://localhost:7000/api/health` to `http://localhost:5000/health`

**5. Expected Responses:**
- Simple version: plain text "Healthy"
- Detailed version: JSON object with status, timestamp, version

**6. Verification Commands:**
- Updated curl examples to use `/health` endpoint
- Added comment showing expected "Healthy" response

**7. AI Prompt Template:**
- Updated to verify `/health` instead of `/api/health`
- Modified validation criteria to accept both text and JSON responses

### Rationale:

The simpler `/health` endpoint returning plain "Healthy" is perfectly valid for basic health checks. It:
- ✅ Minimizes response size
- ✅ Easy to parse by monitoring tools
- ✅ Fast response time
- ✅ Works with standard health check protocols

The documentation now shows both approaches, with your actual implementation as the primary example, making it easier for team members to understand the working endpoint.
