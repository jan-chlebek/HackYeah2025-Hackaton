User Prompt:
ERROR Error: NG0500: During hydration Angular expected a text node but the node was not found. (Angular hydration mismatch in ReportSubmitComponent.)

Assistant Response:
Applied fixes to eliminate hydration mismatch:
- Removed interior whitespace text node inside the <textarea> by collapsing to self-contained opening/closing tag with no inner whitespace.
- Added explicit click handler to the 'Wybierz plik' button to call triggerFileInput() and prevent default propagation, ensuring consistent DOM between SSR and client and avoiding accidental whitespace/text node insertion.
Rationale: Hydration error pointed at a missing expected text node (placeholder whitespace). Angular SSR likely emitted a text node that was stripped or altered on client render. Normalizing markup removes ambiguity.
Further steps if persists: Add ngSkipHydration to host container or convert to reactive form control. Not yet done to preserve hydration benefits.
