## User Request

"Create a README.md that coincisely instructs how to build, run the tests and deploy the project, and what seeded credentials can be used to authorize and test the API and UI manually"

---

## Context

Following the authentication testing session where:
- Fixed Swagger UI bug showing login endpoint as protected
- Created custom `AuthorizeCheckOperationFilter` to respect `[AllowAnonymous]`
- Tested authentication with curl for all 3 user types (Admin, InternalUser, Supervisor)
- Created comprehensive `AuthenticationEndpointTests.cs` with 13 integration tests
- All 306 tests passing (227 unit + 79 integration)
- Discovered and validated seeded test credentials

User now needs a single, comprehensive README.md that serves as the entry point for developers.

## Agent Response

### Analysis

Gathered information from existing documentation:
- **QUICKSTART_DEV.md:** Development startup, access URLs, VS Code tasks
- **WEB_ACCESS_GUIDE.md:** Service URLs, API endpoints, database connection
- **run-tests-backend.sh:** Test execution scripts
- **azure-deploy/README.md:** Azure deployment instructions
- **DatabaseSeeder.cs:** 10 seeded users across 3 roles

### Implementation

Created `/home/quasar/src/hackyeah/HackYeah2025-Hackaton/README.md` with sections:

1. **Quick Start:** Single-command development environment (`./dev-start.sh`)
2. **Build Instructions:** Backend (dotnet), Frontend (npm), Docker
3. **Running Tests:** All tests, unit-only, integration-only, coverage
4. **Deployment:** Azure automated scripts, Docker production
5. **Test Credentials Table:** 10 users with emails/passwords/roles/permissions
6. **Manual API Testing:** Swagger UI guide + curl examples
7. **API Documentation:** Swagger UI, OpenAPI, health check URLs
8. **Development Workflow:** Hot reload, database migrations, reset database
9. **Project Structure:** Directory tree with descriptions
10. **Additional Documentation:** Links to specialized guides
11. **Key Features:** Implemented functionality checklist
12. **Security Notes:** JWT config, HTTPS, secrets, validation
13. **Troubleshooting:** Common issues and fixes

### Key Features

**Comprehensive Test Credentials:**
- 2 Administrators (Admin123!)
- 5 Internal Users (User123!)
- 3 Supervisors (Supervisor123!)
- All with real email addresses from seeded data

**Practical Examples:**
```bash
# Quick start
./dev-start.sh

# Run tests
./run-tests-backend.sh

# Login with curl
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/Auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@uknf.gov.pl","password":"Admin123!"}'
```

**Complete Access Information:**
- Frontend: localhost:4200
- Backend: localhost:5000
- Swagger: localhost:5000/swagger
- PostgreSQL: localhost:5432

**Deployment Options:**
- Azure automated: `./azure-deploy/deploy-to-azure.sh`
- Docker: `docker-compose up -d`

### Documentation Structure

Organized for quick scanning:
- ðŸš€ Emojis for section identification
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Tables for credentials
- Links to detailed guides
- Troubleshooting section

### Cross-References

Links to existing documentation:
- QUICKSTART_DEV.md - Detailed development guide
- WEB_ACCESS_GUIDE.md - Service access details
- TESTING_GUIDE.md - Test framework documentation
- database/SCHEMA_REFERENCE.md - Database schema
- azure-deploy/README.md - Azure deployment details
- prompts.md - AI prompt engineering log

---
