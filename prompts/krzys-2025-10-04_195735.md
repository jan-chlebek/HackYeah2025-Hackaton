## User Prompt

```
Now lets do the communication module. We need:
Preferred functionalities
The Communication Module, which is to enable:
• handling the acceptance of reports submitted by supervised entities with feedback,
• handling messages with the possibility of attaching attachments ensuring two-way
communication between internal and external users,
• maintaining a local file repository that performs the library function,
• handling and handling cases concerning supervised entities,
• handling messages in the form of a bulletin board, with the option to all or to selected
groups of entities, with confirmation of reading by users of entities,
• service of addressees, contact groups and contacts,
• maintaining a database of questions and answers giving the opportunity to ask
questions and view answers in the FAQ convention,
• handling the file of entities and updating information on supervised entities.
```

### Overview
Implemented a comprehensive Communication Module for the UKNF platform covering all 8 required functional areas with complete database schema, entities, and EF Core configuration.

### What Was Implemented

#### 1. **Enums Created** (`UknfCommunicationPlatform.Core/Enums/`)

- **MessageStatus.cs** - 7 states for message lifecycle:
  - Draft, Sent, Read, AwaitingUknfResponse, AwaitingUserResponse, Closed, Cancelled

- **MessageFolder.cs** - 6 folder categories for organizing messages:
  - Inbox, Sent, Drafts, Reports, Cases, Applications

- **CaseStatus.cs** - 7 states for administrative cases:
  - New, InProgress, AwaitingUknfResponse, AwaitingUserResponse, Resolved, Closed, Cancelled

- **AnnouncementPriority.cs** - 3 priority levels for bulletin board:
  - Low, Medium, High (High requires read confirmation)

  - Submitted, InProgress, Answered, Published, Rejected

#### 2. **Core Entities Created** (`UknfCommunicationPlatform.Core/Entities/`)

- **CaseHistory.cs** - Audit trail for cases:
  - Change type tracking
  - Status change logging (old/new status)
  - User who made changes

**Bulletin Board/Announcements:**
- **Announcement.cs** - Bulletin board messages:
  - Title and WYSIWYG HTML content
  - Category organization
  - Priority levels (Low/Medium/High)
  - Publication workflow (IsPublished flag)
  - Expiration dates
  - Created by UKNF staff
  - Collections: attachments, read confirmations, recipients, history

- **AnnouncementAttachment.cs** - Files attached to announcements:

- **AnnouncementRead.cs** - Read confirmation tracking:
  - For high-priority announcements
  - User ID and timestamp
  - IP address logging
  - Unique constraint (one read per user per announcement)

- **AnnouncementRecipient.cs** - Flexible recipient targeting:
  - RecipientType: User, SupervisedEntity, PodmiotType, AllExternal, AllInternal
  - Optional user, entity, or podmiot type filters
  - Supports group messaging

- **AnnouncementHistory.cs** - Change tracking for announcements:
  - Change types: Created, Published, Updated, Unpublished, Deleted
  - User who made changes
  - Timestamp

**File Library/Repository:**
- **FileLibrary.cs** - Document repository:
  - Name, description, category
  - File metadata (name, path, size, MIME type)
  - Tags for search
  - Version control (version number, parent file relationship)
  - IsCurrentVersion flag
  - Public/private access control
  - Upload tracking
  - Download counter
  - Permissions collection

- **FileLibraryPermission.cs** - Granular access control:
  - PermissionType: User, Role, SupervisedEntity, PodmiotType
  - Optional filters (user ID, role name, entity ID, podmiot type)
  - Permissions: CanRead, CanWrite, CanDelete
  - Supports complex access scenarios

**FAQ System:**
- **FaqQuestion.cs** - Q&A database:
  - Title and content
  - Category and tags
  - Status workflow (FaqQuestionStatus enum)
  - Answer content (WYSIWYG HTML)
  - Answered by UKNF staff
  - Submitted by user or anonymous
  - Anonymous submission support (name, email)
  - View counter
  - Rating system (average rating, rating count)
  - Publication workflow

- **FaqRating.cs** - User ratings for answers:
  - Rating 1-5 stars

#### 3. **Database Configuration Updates**

**ApplicationDbContext.cs** - Added all new DbSets:
- 23 new Communication Module DbSets
- Comprehensive relationship configuration
- Index optimization for:
  - Message threads and read status
  - Case status and entity relationships
  - Announcement expiration and publication
  - File library categories and versions
  - FAQ status and publication
  - Contact entity relationships

**Key Relationship Patterns:**
- **Messages**: Sender/Recipient with Restrict delete, Thread hierarchy, Optional relationships to Reports/Cases/Entities
- **Cases**: Supervised entity (Restrict), Handler (SetNull), Creator (Restrict), Cascade delete for documents/history
- **Announcements**: Cascade delete for attachments/reads/recipients/history
- **FileLibrary**: Self-referencing for versioning (Restrict), Cascade delete for permissions
- **FAQ**: Optional submitter/answerer (SetNull), Cascade delete for ratings
- **Contacts**: Cascade delete from entity, Restrict from creator

**Index Strategy:**
- Composite indexes for filtered queries (status + date, entity + status)
- Unique constraints for business rules (case number, announcement read tracking, FAQ ratings)
- Performance indexes on timestamps for auditing

#### 4. **Migration Created**

- **CommunicationModuleEntities** migration:
  - Creates 17 new tables with snake_case naming
  - All foreign key relationships
  - All indexes and constraints
  - Ready for PostgreSQL deployment
