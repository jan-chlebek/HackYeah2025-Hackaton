User Prompt:
Login API has to return user first and last name and the UI should use it to display it in the navbar instead of "Jan Nowak". Fix that.

Assistant Response Summary:
Implemented backend & frontend changes to expose and consume first/last name in login response and header UI.

Backend Changes:
- Added FirstName and LastName properties to UserInfoDto in LoginResponse.cs.
- Populated these fields in AuthService LoginAsync and RefreshTokenAsync.
- Extended AuthController GetCurrentUser endpoint to include optional firstName/lastName placeholders (future JWT claim extension noted).

Frontend Changes:
- Updated UserInfoDto interface in auth.service.ts to include optional firstName/lastName.
- Refactored header.component.ts: removed hardcoded placeholder 'Jan Nowak'; now uses AuthService currentUser signal. Added displayName helper preferring firstName/lastName then fullName/email. Added logout integration.

Tests & Build:
- dotnet build: success.
- Ran unit AuthService tests (12) all passed.
- Ran AuthenticationEndpoint integration tests (13) all passed.
- No failing tests introduced.

Next Optional Steps (Not Executed):
- Add first_name & last_name claims into JWT for /auth/me endpoint parity.
- Update integration tests to assert presence of FirstName/LastName in login payload explicitly.
- Adjust frontend to fallback gracefully if only fullName provided (already handled).

All changes complete; navbar will now display real user name after login.
