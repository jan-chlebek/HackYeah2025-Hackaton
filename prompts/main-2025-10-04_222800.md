# Prompt: Fix Navigation Item Text Overflow

**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Branch:** main  
**Time:** 22:28:00

## User Prompt

```
It works here, but the same issue is in the first position of the menu (attached image)
```

## Context

The user reported that the menu item text "Biblioteka - repozytorium plik√≥w" was being cut off in the sidebar navigation. The text is too long to fit within the 260px sidebar width along with the icon and padding.

The screenshot showed the text being truncated mid-word, creating a poor user experience.

## AI Response

I fixed the navigation label styling to properly handle text overflow with ellipsis.

### Files Modified

**app.css**
- Updated `.nav-label` class with text overflow handling:
  - Added `overflow: hidden` to prevent text from breaking the layout
  - Added `text-overflow: ellipsis` to show "..." when text is too long
  - Added `white-space: nowrap` to prevent text wrapping to multiple lines
  - Added `flex: 1` to allow the label to take available space in the flex container

### CSS Changes

```css
.nav-label {
  font-size: 0.9rem;
  overflow: hidden;           /* NEW: Hide overflow */
  text-overflow: ellipsis;    /* NEW: Add ellipsis (...) for overflow */
  white-space: nowrap;        /* NEW: Prevent wrapping */
  flex: 1;                    /* NEW: Take available space */
}
```

### Result

Now when navigation items have long text:
- ‚úÖ Text that doesn't fit shows ellipsis (...) at the end
- ‚úÖ Example: "Biblioteka - repozytorium pli..." instead of being cut off mid-word
- ‚úÖ Maintains clean, professional appearance
- ‚úÖ Users can still identify the menu item from the visible portion
- ‚úÖ Hover tooltips could be added later to show full text

### Visual Improvement

**Before:**
```
üìÅ Biblioteka - repozytorium plik√≥
```

**After:**
```
üìÅ Biblioteka - repozytorium pli...
```

The ellipsis makes it clear that there's more text, and it's a standard UI pattern that users understand.

## Effectiveness Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

This fix:
1. Solved the text cutoff issue elegantly
2. Used standard CSS text-overflow pattern
3. Maintained visual consistency
4. Works automatically for all menu items
5. No JavaScript or complex logic needed

## Technical Notes

- The 260px sidebar width includes padding and the icon, leaving approximately 200px for text
- "Biblioteka - repozytorium plik√≥w" is about 31 characters, which at 0.9rem can exceed available space
- The ellipsis provides clear visual feedback that text is truncated
- `flex: 1` ensures the label takes all available space between the icon and the end of the container
- This pattern is used across modern web applications (VS Code, GitHub, etc.)

## Follow-up Improvements

Could add:
- Title attribute on hover to show full text
- Tooltip component for full text display
- Slightly wider sidebar (280px instead of 260px) if design allows
- Abbreviate menu item text in the data itself
