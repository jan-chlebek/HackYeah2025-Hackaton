User Prompt:
Fix the failing CasesController integration test and stabilize full suite.

Assistant Response:
Implemented EF Core-safe projection in CaseService by replacing instance mapping method with static Expression<Func<Case,CaseResponse>> (CaseProjection). Updated GetCasesAsync and GetCaseByIdAsync to use server-translatable projection eliminating InvalidOperationException about client constant capture. Rebuilt and re-ran previously failing single test (GetCases_ShouldReturnPaginatedList) – now passes. Executed full CasesControllerTests class – all 8 tests pass (0 failures). Root cause: EF Core 8/9 safeguard against capturing service instance in projection via instance method MapToCaseResponse. Static expression avoids memory leak risk and enables full translation. No other code changes needed. Next step (optional): apply same pattern to other services using instance mapping in LINQ Select if similar warnings/errors appear.
