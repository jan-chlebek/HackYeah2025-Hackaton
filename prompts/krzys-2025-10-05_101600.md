Fix unit tests / Fix tests quickly

Assistant Response:
Identified and fixed the single failing unit test:
- SwaggerConfigurationTests.SwaggerJson_ShouldContainExpectedEndpoints was checking for `/api/announcements` but AnnouncementsController uses `/api/v1/announcements` route.
- Updated test to use correct route path with v1 prefix.
- All 265 unit tests now pass.
