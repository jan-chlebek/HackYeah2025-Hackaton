User Prompt:
Fix integration tests

Assistant Response:
All integration tests now pass (88/88).

Issue: AnnouncementsControllerTests were using `/api/announcements` routes but the actual controller route is `/api/v1/announcements`.

Fix: Updated all announcement endpoint paths in AnnouncementsControllerTests.cs to use the correct `/api/v1/announcements` prefix using sed bulk replacement.

Result:
- All 15 AnnouncementsController integration tests now pass
- Full integration test suite: 88/88 passed
