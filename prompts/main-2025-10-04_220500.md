# Prompt: Remove Angular Default Welcome Page

**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Branch:** main  
**Time:** 22:05:00

## User Prompt

```
Above page still there is a sample for angular project (see attached screenshot). Can you remove it? I want to display only dashboard there.
```

## Context

The user noticed that the Angular default welcome page (with the Angular logo, "Hello, uknf-project" heading, documentation links, and social media icons) was displaying above the dashboard component. The screenshot showed both the Angular welcome content and the dashboard breadcrumb/tabs appearing on the same page.

## AI Response

I identified the issue in the main app component template (`app.html`). The file contained the entire Angular CLI starter template with:
- Extensive inline styles for the welcome page
- Angular logo SVG
- Welcome heading and text
- Links to Angular documentation
- Social media icons
- All wrapped in a `<main>` element

The `<router-outlet />` tag was present at the bottom, but all the welcome content was rendering above it.

### Solution

Replaced the entire contents of `app.html` with just the router outlet:

```html
<router-outlet />
```

This removes all the Angular boilerplate welcome content and displays only the routed components (dashboard, etc.).

### Files Modified

1. **app.html**
   - Removed ~200 lines of Angular starter template code
   - Removed all inline styles
   - Removed Angular logo SVG and welcome content
   - Removed documentation links and social media icons
   - Kept only the `<router-outlet />` element

### Result

The application now displays only the dashboard component when navigating to `/` or `/dashboard`, without any Angular welcome page content above it. The clean UKNF-branded dashboard is now the primary interface.

## Effectiveness Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

This prompt was highly effective because:
1. The user provided a clear screenshot showing the issue
2. The problem description was specific and actionable
3. The solution was straightforward - remove boilerplate content
4. The fix took only one file edit with immediate visual results

## Notes

- This is a common step when setting up a new Angular project
- The Angular CLI generates starter content that should typically be removed when beginning actual development
- The `<router-outlet />` is the Angular directive that renders the active route's component
