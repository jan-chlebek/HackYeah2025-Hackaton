# Prompt Log: Frontend Login Accessibility Cycle
**Branch:** FrontendNG  
**Timestamp:** 2025-10-05 06:35:06

## Recent Request Cycle

### 1. Font control lettering
- **Prompt:** "Letters here should have different sizes"
- **Summary:** Adjusted `.font-btn` styling so the small/medium/large buttons render with distinct font sizes while keeping the active-state visuals consistent.
- **Files:** `frontend/uknf-project/src/app/shared/components/accessibility-controls/accessibility-controls.component.scss`
- **Tests:** Not run (Angular unit test command was cancelled before completion).

### 2. Password minlength validation timing
- **Prompt:** "Validation for minimal amount of characters in password should not be visible in frontend before login button is pressed"
- **Summary:** Added a `formSubmitted` signal to defer the minlength error until submission, and extended `login.component.spec.ts` with a regression test capturing the desired behaviour.
- **Files:**
  - `frontend/uknf-project/src/app/features/auth/login/login.component.ts`
  - `frontend/uknf-project/src/app/features/auth/login/login.component.spec.ts`
- **Tests:** Not run (Angular unit test command was cancelled before completion).

### 3. High-contrast email field styling
- **Prompt:** "Filled email field in login panel should keep same dark styling in high contrast. It now shifts to light for some reason"
- **Summary:** Layered high-contrast overrides in `login.component.scss` to maintain a black background and yellow text/border, including autofill handling so the email field remains dark when populated.
- **Files:** `frontend/uknf-project/src/app/features/auth/login/login.component.scss`
- **Tests:** Not run (Angular unit test command was cancelled before completion).

## Prompt
Can you document in prompt folder the cycle of requests I've just made?

## Response
Documenting the recent login tweaks next; I'll capture the latest prompts, log them, and recap the updates.

- Summarize each of the three recent frontend requests with the corresponding code changes.
- Write a prompt log in `prompts/FrontendNG-2025-10-05_063506.md` that includes this prompt and my response.
- Report on test execution status and outstanding follow-ups.

## actions taken
- Differentiated the “A” accessibility font controls so small/medium/large buttons render at 1rem, 1.25rem, and 1.5rem respectively while preserving hover/active styling.
- Deferred the password minlength validation message until after submission by tracking `formSubmitted`, and added a unit test proving the pre-submit state stays quiet.
- Hardened high-contrast overrides on the login form so autofilled inputs stay black with yellow text/border, matching the requested dark styling.

## documentation
- Added `prompts/FrontendNG-2025-10-05_063506.md` to capture the latest request cycle plus this response, keeping the prompt history up to date.

## tests
- Not run — attempts to execute `npx ng test --watch=false --browsers=ChromeHeadless` were cancelled before completion.

## requirements coverage
- Letters in accessibility font controls show different sizes – **Done** via updated `.font-btn` styling.
- Password minlength validation hidden until submit – **Done** with the `formSubmitted` gate and accompanying unit test.
- High-contrast email field retains dark styling – **Done** through new SCSS overrides and autofill handling.
- Document the recent prompt cycle – **Done** in `prompts/FrontendNG-2025-10-05_063506.md`.

## notes
- Please rerun the Angular unit test suite when convenient to confirm `login.component.spec.ts` passes after the new coverage.
