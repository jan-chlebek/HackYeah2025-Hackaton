**User Request:**
run unit test for creating script and for seeding. If it nessesery, fix errors

**Branch:** jz

## Response Summary

**Issue Identified:**
The ReportingPeriodType field was missing from API responses despite:
- Database column existing with correct data
- Entity property configured correctly
- DTO including the property
- Controller projection referencing it

**Root Cause:**
EF Core's model snapshot didn't include the ReportingPeriodType property. The application was using cached build artifacts that pre-dated the migration, causing EF Core to exclude the column from generated SQL queries.

**Solution Applied:**
1. Created EF Core migration for ReportingPeriodType property
2. Marked migration as applied in database
3. Performed complete clean build: `dotnet clean` + removed bin/obj folders
4. Docker rebuild with `--no-cache` flag to eliminate cached layers
5. Verified all tests pass (222/222)

**Final State:**
 ReportingPeriodType appears in JSON responses (values: 0=None, 1=Annual, 2=Quarterly)
 Filtering by reportingPeriodType parameter works correctly
 All 222 tests pass (202 unit + 20 integration)
 Database seeded with 3 test files covering all enum values

**Key Learnings:**
- Docker layer caching can persist old build artifacts even after code changes
- EF Core requires migrations to update its internal model snapshot
- Always use `--no-cache` when debugging mysterious missing-property issues
- Clean build (dotnet clean + remove bin/obj) is essential after major ORM changes

## Test Results

### API Response Test
```
id name               reportingPeriodType
-- ----               -------------------
 5 Annual Report 2024                   1
 6 General Document                     0
 4 Test File Q1                         2
```

### Filter Tests
- Quarterly (type=2):  Returns 1 file (Test File Q1)
- Annual (type=1):  Returns 1 file (Annual Report 2024)
- None (type=0):  Returns 1 file (General Document)

### Unit & Integration Tests
- Unit tests:  202/202 passed
- Integration tests:  20/20 passed
- **Total: 222/222 PASSED**

## Files Modified

1. **ApplicationDbContext.cs** - Added using alias for ReportingPeriodType to avoid naming conflicts
2. **FileLibraryController.cs** - Multiple iterations to fix EF Core query projection
3. **Migration created:** `20251005044626_AddReportingPeriodTypeColumn.cs`
4. **Model snapshot updated** with ReportingPeriodType property

## Commands Executed

```bash
# Create migration
dotnet ef migrations add AddReportingPeriodTypeColumn

# Clean build artifacts
dotnet clean
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force backend/*/bin, backend/*/obj

# Full rebuild

# Run tests
dotnet test --no-build -c Release
```

## Database State

```sql
SELECT id, name, reporting_period_type FROM file_libraries ORDER BY id;
-- Results:
--  4 | Test File Q1       | Quarterly
--  5 | Annual Report 2024 | Annual
--  6 | General Document   | None
