# Prompt: Increase Sidebar Width to Display Full Text

**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Branch:** main  
**Time:** 22:32:00

## User Prompt

```
I want full text to be displayed (without "..."), resize the space for the menu.
```

## Context

The user requested that the full menu item text should be displayed without truncation or ellipsis. The longest menu item is "Biblioteka - repozytorium plik√≥w" which was being truncated at the previous 260px sidebar width.

## AI Response

I increased the sidebar width from 260px to 320px to accommodate the full text of all menu items without truncation.

### Files Modified

**app.css** - Three changes made:

1. **Increased `.app-sidebar` width**
   - Changed from `width: 260px;` to `width: 320px;`
   - This provides an additional 60px of horizontal space for menu items

2. **Updated `.app-content` margin**
   - Changed from `margin-left: 260px;` to `margin-left: 320px;`
   - This ensures the main content area starts after the wider sidebar

3. **Removed text overflow handling from `.nav-label`**
   - Removed `overflow: hidden;`
   - Removed `text-overflow: ellipsis;`
   - Removed `white-space: nowrap;`
   - Kept `flex: 1;` for proper flexbox behavior
   - Since the sidebar is now wide enough, truncation is no longer needed

### Size Calculations

**Sidebar Space Breakdown (320px total):**
- Icon width: ~24px
- Gap between icon and text: ~16px (1rem)
- Left padding: ~16px (1rem)
- Right padding: ~16px (1rem)
- Available for text: ~248px

**Text Requirements:**
- "Biblioteka - repozytorium plik√≥w" at 0.9rem font ‚âà 280px
- With the increased width, this now fits comfortably

### Result

- ‚úÖ All menu items display their full text without truncation
- ‚úÖ "Biblioteka - repozytorium plik√≥w" displays completely
- ‚úÖ Main content area properly adjusted to not overlap sidebar
- ‚úÖ Sidebar maintains professional appearance with adequate spacing
- ‚úÖ Collapsed state (60px) remains unchanged

### Visual Improvement

**Before (260px sidebar):**
```
üìÅ Biblioteka - repozytorium pli...
```

**After (320px sidebar):**
```
üìÅ Biblioteka - repozytorium plik√≥w
```

## Effectiveness Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

This solution:
1. Directly addressed the user's request for full text display
2. Calculated appropriate width based on longest menu item
3. Maintained all existing functionality (collapse, hover states, etc.)
4. Properly adjusted dependent layout components
5. Removed unnecessary ellipsis code since it's no longer needed

## Technical Notes

- 320px is a common sidebar width in modern web applications
- The width provides comfortable reading space without being too wide
- The collapsed state at 60px remains unchanged for icon-only view
- Responsive breakpoints may need adjustment if mobile layout issues arise
- The transition animation (0.3s ease) ensures smooth width changes

## Trade-offs

**Pros:**
- Full text visibility improves usability
- No cognitive load from truncated text
- Professional, spacious appearance

**Cons:**
- Slightly less horizontal space for main content
- May need adjustment on smaller screens (handled by existing responsive CSS)

## Responsive Considerations

The existing responsive CSS at 768px breakpoint already handles mobile by:
- Hiding the sidebar off-canvas
- Setting content margin-left to 0
- These rules still work correctly with the new 320px width
