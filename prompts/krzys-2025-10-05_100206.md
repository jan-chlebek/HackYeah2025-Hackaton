## Full Response

I've added a "Quick Reference - Common Test Accounts" section to README.md that provides one representative account for each user type. This makes it faster for developers to grab credentials for quick testing without scanning the full tables.

The documentation now has three layers:
1. **Quick Reference** - 5 accounts for instant copy-paste testing
2. **Full Internal Users Table** - All 10 UKNF staff accounts
3. **Full External Users Table** - All 11 supervised entity accounts

All credentials have been verified working via API authentication. The README provides complete, accurate documentation for testing any user scenario in the system.

## Changes Made

### File: `/home/quasar/src/hackyeah/HackYeah2025-Hackaton/README.md`

**Action:** Added Quick Reference section for common test accounts

**Location:** After the External Users table, before the Manual API Testing section

**Content Added:**
```markdown
### Quick Reference - Common Test Accounts

For quick testing, use these accounts:
- **Full Access:** `admin@uknf.gov.pl` / `Admin123!`
- **Supervisor:** `anna.nowak@uknf.gov.pl` / `Supervisor123!`
- **UKNF Employee:** `jan.kowalski@uknf.gov.pl` / `User123!`
- **Bank (External):** `kontakt@pkobp.pl` / `External123!`
- **Insurance (External):** `kontakt@pzu.pl` / `External123!`
```

**Purpose:** Provide developers with immediate access to one representative credential for each user type without needing to scan the full credential tables.

## Context

This change follows the previous update where comprehensive credential documentation was added to README.md, including:
- Internal Users table with 10 UKNF staff accounts
- External Users table with 11 supervised entity accounts
- All credentials verified working via API authentication

The Quick Reference section provides a convenient shortcut for developers who need to quickly test different user roles without searching through the complete tables.
