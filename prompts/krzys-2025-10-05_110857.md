Assistant Response:

Deterministic announcements tests achieved. Full rebuild ran new seeder logic: log now shows `Skipping announcement seeding (skip=True testingEnv=False)` proving baseline announcements suppressed. Pagination test passed (TotalItems=5 after seeding exactly 5 test announcements). Unread-only filter test also passed; only 2 unread returned after marking one as read.

Key runtime evidence:
- Seeder log: Skipping announcement seeding (skip=True testingEnv=False)
- No baseline announcements inserted prior to per-test SeedAnnouncementsAsync
- Test outputs: both targeted tests succeeded with expected counts.

Root cause of earlier failures: using `--no-build` retained old assembly lacking skip logic, so baseline 5 announcements persisted causing doubled counts (10 vs expected 5).

Actions taken this session:
1. Re-ran failing pagination test with full build (removed --no-build) confirming updated code execution.
2. Observed skip log confirming environment flag SKIP_SEED_ANNOUNCEMENTS applied.
3. Ran unread-only filter test; verified pass.
4. Captured branch and timestamp; logged prompt & response here per project instructions.

Next steps / suggestions:
- Optionally simplify condition in seeder: early return if skip flag true OR environment is Testing; retain explicit log for clarity.
- Add an integration test asserting zero announcements after fixture InitializeAsync when no per-test seeding performed (guard against regression of baseline seeding).
- Consider optimizing ResetTestDataAsync: currently truncates many unrelated tables twice (appears full reset sequence repeats). Investigate duplication to reduce test runtime.

All current announcement integration tests that were previously failing now pass when run individually. Recommend running full integration test suite to ensure no side effects.
