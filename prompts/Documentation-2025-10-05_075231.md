# Prompt Documentation: Excalidraw Diagram Creation

**Branch:** Documentation  
**Date:** 2025-10-05  
**Time:** 07:52:31  
**Context:** Creating documentation for AI development practices with visual diagrams

## User Prompt

"Can you generate me a tool that will combine all files in this folder and will generate pdf out of md with table of contest?"

Then followed by requests to:
- Add Mermaid diagram support
- Create an Excalidraw diagram for human-in-the-loop process
- Make text labels visible and properly sized
- Add feedback loop arrow
- Export to PNG for documentation

## AI Response Summary

Created multiple artifacts:
1. PDF generation tool (`generate_ai_doc_pdf.js`)
2. Excalidraw diagram (`assets/human-in-the-loop.excalidraw`)
3. PNG export of the diagram
4. Updated markdown documentation with embedded diagram

## Key Prompts for Excalidraw Diagram Creation

### Initial Diagram Request
```
I want to use this chapter to list good prompting practices. I want to mention that prompts should be feature oriented and code result should be always reviewed by developer. There are two types of developers with AI - the ones who read and optimize code and the ones who doesn't read and pray.

Prompts should be always written in english as it's primary internet language

Create an excalidraw diagram that should demonstrate human in the loop process. For example when creating requirements file, model was prompted 3 times before checking the output if something important was not missed
```

**Effectiveness: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐**  
This prompt was highly effective because it:
- Provided clear context about the purpose
- Specified the diagram type (Excalidraw)
- Gave a concrete example (requirements file, 3 iterations)
- Explained the concept (human-in-the-loop)

### Making Text Visible in Excalidraw
```
Texts are still not visible
```

**Effectiveness: ⭐⭐⭐**  
This simple prompt triggered the AI to:
- Investigate the Excalidraw JSON structure
- Understand that text needs to be separate elements, not properties
- Create proper text elements with `containerId` bindings
- Position text correctly within rectangles

**Key Learning:** Excalidraw requires text as separate elements bound to shapes via `containerId`, not as shape properties.

### Adding Feedback Loop
```
Add arrow between Human Review and prompt 2 - repeat N-times to ensure consistency
```

**Effectiveness: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐**  
This prompt was effective because it:
- Specified exact connection points (Human Review → Prompt 2)
- Included the label text
- Implied visual distinction (the AI chose red dashed line)

### Text Sizing
```
Can you make all texts XL size?
```

**Effectiveness: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐**  
Simple, direct, actionable. The AI increased all font sizes from 14/12 to 20/18.

### Adding Visual Reference to Documentation
```
Add png file as a reference
```

**Effectiveness: ⭐⭐⭐⭐**  
Short but clear. The AI:
- Checked for existing PNG
- Added markdown image syntax
- Kept the Excalidraw link for editability

## Technical Details

### Excalidraw JSON Structure
Key elements for creating diagrams programmatically:

```json
{
  "type": "excalidraw",
  "version": 2,
  "elements": [
    {
      "id": "unique-id",
      "type": "rectangle|arrow|text",
      "x": 0, "y": 0,
      "width": 180, "height": 60,
      "strokeColor": "#1a1a1a",
      "backgroundColor": "#fff",
      "boundElements": [{"id": "text-id", "type": "text"}]
    },
    {
      "id": "text-id",
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Your text here",
      "fontSize": 20,
      "containerId": "unique-id",
      "textAlign": "center",
      "verticalAlign": "middle"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Color Conventions Used
- **White boxes** (`#fff`): Regular process steps
- **Green box** (`#e0ffe0`): Human intervention/review point
- **Red dashed arrow** (`#d63031`, dashed): Feedback loop
- **Black solid arrows** (`#1a1a1a`, solid): Forward flow

## Lessons Learned

1. **Incremental Development**: The diagram was built step-by-step through multiple prompts, each refining a specific aspect.

2. **Human-in-the-Loop in Practice**: This very conversation demonstrated the process shown in the diagram - multiple iterations with review between steps.

3. **Visual Communication**: A simple diagram can convey complex iterative processes more effectively than text alone.

4. **File Organization**: Separating assets into dedicated folders and providing both editable and rendered versions improves documentation usability.

5. **Prompt Clarity**: Specific requests (e.g., "XL size", "arrow from X to Y") get better results than vague descriptions.

## Best Practices for Diagram Creation Prompts

1. **Specify the tool/format**: "Create an Excalidraw diagram" vs just "create a diagram"
2. **Provide concrete examples**: "3 prompt iterations" vs "show iterations"
3. **Use visual language**: Colors, shapes, arrows, labels
4. **Iterate incrementally**: Get basic structure first, then refine
5. **Request both formats**: Editable source + rendered image for documentation

## Files Modified/Created

- `generate_ai_doc_pdf.js` - PDF generation tool with Mermaid support
- `AIDevelopment_Documentation/assets/human-in-the-loop.excalidraw` - Diagram source
- `AIDevelopment_Documentation/assets/human-in-the-loop.excalidraw.png` - Rendered image
- `AIDevelopment_Documentation/2.1 Good practise - prompt structure.md` - Updated documentation
- `AIDevelopment_Documentation/README_generate_pdf.md` - Tool usage guide

## Outcome

Successfully created comprehensive documentation that:
- Explains prompting best practices
- Visualizes the human-in-the-loop concept
- Provides both editable and viewable diagram formats
- Can be exported to PDF with table of contents
- Demonstrates the very principles it teaches
