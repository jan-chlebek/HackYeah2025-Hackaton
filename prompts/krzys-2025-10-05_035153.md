# Prompt: Fix failing integration tests

## User Request
Fix failing integration tests

## Analysis

Upon running the backend tests, I discovered 3 failing integration tests:
1. `ReportsEndpoint_ReturnsReports` - Expected 200 OK but got 404 Not Found
2. `ReportById_ReturnsReportDetails` - JSON deserialization error (empty response)
3. `ReportsEndpoint_WithFilters_ReturnsFilteredResults` - JSON deserialization error (empty response)

**Root Cause:** The Reports API endpoints were completely missing from the backend, even though:
- The `Report` entity existed in the Core layer
- Database table `reports` was properly configured
- Seed data generation was already implemented in `DatabaseSeeder`
- Tests expected the endpoints at `/api/v1/reports`

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Report DTOs
**File:** `backend/UknfCommunicationPlatform.Core/DTOs/Reports/ReportDto.cs`
- `Id` (long)
- `ReportNumber` (string)
- `ReportingPeriod` (string) - Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4
- `EntityName` (string) - User's full name who submitted the report

### 2. Created Reports Service
**File:** `backend/UknfCommunicationPlatform.Infrastructure/Services/ReportsService.cs`

Methods:
- `GetReportsAsync(string? reportingPeriod)` - List reports with optional filtering
- `GetReportByIdAsync(long id)` - Get single report details

Key implementation details:
- Uses Entity Framework with Include for user relationship
- Filters by ReportingPeriod enum when provided
- Maps `FirstName + " " + LastName` to EntityName (User doesn't have FullName property)
- Orders by SubmittedAt descending

### 3. Created Reports Controller
**File:** `backend/UknfCommunicationPlatform.Api/Controllers/v1/ReportsController.cs`

Endpoints:
- `GET /api/v1/reports?reportingPeriod={period}` - List with optional filter
- `GET /api/v1/reports/{id}` - Get by ID

Features:
- Authorization temporarily disabled (consistent with other controllers)
- Proper error handling with try-catch
- 404 response when report not found
- Swagger documentation via XML comments

### 4. Registered Service in DI Container
**File:** `backend/UknfCommunicationPlatform.Infrastructure/Extensions/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`
- Added `services.AddScoped<ReportsService>()` alongside other services

### 5. Bug Fixes During Development
- **Issue:** Build error - `User.FullName` doesn't exist
- **Fix:** Changed to `FirstName + " " + LastName` concatenation

## Test Results

### Before Fix:
```
Failed!  - Failed:     3, Passed:    17, Skipped:     0, Total:    20
```

### After Fix:
```
Passed!  - Failed:     0, Passed:   133, Skipped:     0, Total:   133 (Unit Tests)
Passed!  - Failed:     0, Passed:    20, Skipped:     0, Total:    20 (Integration Tests)
```

**All tests now passing! âœ…**

## Files Created
1. `backend/UknfCommunicationPlatform.Core/DTOs/Reports/ReportDto.cs`
2. `backend/UknfCommunicationPlatform.Infrastructure/Services/ReportsService.cs`
3. `backend/UknfCommunicationPlatform.Api/Controllers/v1/ReportsController.cs`

## Files Modified
1. `backend/UknfCommunicationPlatform.Infrastructure/Extensions/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`

## Remaining Issues
- 10 nullable reference warnings in `EntityManagementService.cs` (pre-existing, not addressed in this fix)

## Key Learnings
- Integration tests can reveal missing API endpoints that should exist based on entity models
- Always verify entity property names before using them (FullName vs FirstName/LastName)
- Consistent patterns across controllers (authorization disabled, error handling) make implementation easier
- Seed data was already in place, which helped tests pass immediately once endpoints were created
