User Prompt:
List of reports shows for a while but disappears, fix it.

Assistant Response:
Modified reports-list.component.ts to always load backend data after initial mock paint, added mapping + fallback to prevent clearing table on error/empty fast response.
Added defensive transformation of okresSprawozdawczy filter to quarter token (Q1 etc.).
Preserved previous data if backend returns empty array or errors, stopping flicker/disappearance.
Potential next step: remove mock generator entirely once backend fully supports pagination and richer DTO.
