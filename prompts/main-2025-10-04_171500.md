# Response

I fixed Windows CRLF issues in `dev-start.sh`, removed an extraneous character in `docker-compose.yml`, and added a Windows-friendly launcher `dev-start.ps1`. Docker Desktop is currently not running, which prevents containers from starting. Please start Docker Desktop, then run `pwsh -NoProfile -File ./dev-start.ps1 -ComposeFile docker-compose.dev.yml`. If you prefer, you can also run `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build -d` to start all services. Once Docker is up, the scripts will bring up Postgres, then the backend with logs in the foreground.

Changes made:
- Converted `dev-start.sh` to LF line endings and added compatibility for both `docker compose` and `docker-compose`.
- Cleaned `docker-compose.yml` by removing a stray `h` character.
- Added `dev-start.ps1` for Windows PowerShell users, with health-check logic and clear guidance.

Next: Start Docker Desktop and re-run `dev-start.ps1`. If anything fails after Docker is up, share the error and Iâ€™ll iterate until the environment runs successfully.
