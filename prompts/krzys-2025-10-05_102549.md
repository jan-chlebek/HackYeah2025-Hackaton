# Prompt: Continue fixing errors

## User Request
Continue fixing errors

## Response Summary
Fixed multiple compilation warnings and started addressing integration test failures:

### Warnings Fixed (All 22 warnings resolved):
1. **Nullable value type warnings** in DatabaseSeeder.cs (lines 925, 944)
   - Added null-forgiving operator `!` to `RecipientId!.Value`

2. **Possible null reference assignment warnings** in EntityManagementService.cs
   - Added null-coalescing operators `?? string.Empty` for all nullable string properties in both Create and Update methods

3. **SQL injection warning** in DatabaseSeeder.cs (line 136)
   - Suppressed EF1002 warning with pragma directives as TRUNCATE is safe with table names

4. **Dereference of possibly null reference warnings** in EntitiesControllerTests.cs
   - Added null-forgiving operator `!` to all `value` and `data` property accesses

### Integration Test Failures Addressed:
**Issue**: All 87 integration tests were failing with "duplicate key value violates unique constraint 'i_x_permissions_name'"

**Root Cause**: Race condition in TestDatabaseFixture where multiple test collections were initializing fixtures in parallel, each trying to seed permissions simultaneously.

**Solution**: 
- Added static `SemaphoreSlim _seedLock` and `_globalIsSeeded` flag to TestDatabaseFixture
- Wrapped seeding logic in lock to ensure only one fixture seeds the database
- Added `_context.ChangeTracker.Clear()` after clearing data to ensure fresh state

**Current Status**:
- Build: ✓ PASSED (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- Unit Tests: ✓ PASSED (265/265 tests)
- Integration Tests: ⚠️ PARTIAL (15/87 passed, 72 failed)

**Remaining Integration Test Issues**:
- Login tests failing with 401 Unauthorized (password verification issue)
- Many tests failing with "Sequence contains no elements" when getting authenticated clients
- Suggests password hashing mismatch between seeding and verification

## Files Modified
1. `backend/UknfCommunicationPlatform.Infrastructure/Data/DatabaseSeeder.cs`
   - Fixed nullable warnings
   - Suppressed SQL injection warning
   - Added ChangeTracker.Clear() after force reseed

2. `backend/UknfCommunicationPlatform.Infrastructure/Services/EntityManagementService.cs`
   - Fixed null reference warnings in Create and Update methods

3. `backend/UknfCommunicationPlatform.Tests.Unit/Controllers/EntitiesControllerTests.cs`
   - Fixed null dereference warnings

4. `backend/UknfCommunicationPlatform.Tests.Integration/TestDatabaseFixture.cs`
   - Added SemaphoreSlim for thread-safe seeding
   - Added global seeding flag
   - Wrapped seeding in lock

## Next Steps
Need to investigate password verification issue causing login failures in integration tests.
