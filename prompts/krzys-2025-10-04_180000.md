**User:**
I want to use Azure Web App for Containers (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)

**Copilot:**
Great choice! Here’s the step-by-step plan to deploy your solution using Azure Web App for Containers:

1. Build Docker images for backend and frontend.
2. Push images to Azure Container Registry (ACR).
3. Provision Azure Web Apps for backend and frontend, configure them to use your images.
4. Provision Azure Database for PostgreSQL and update connection strings.
5. Configure environment variables/secrets in Azure.
6. Set up networking and HTTPS.

Let’s start by generating the required Azure resources and deployment scripts. I’ll create:

- An `azure-deploy/` directory with:
  - A Bicep or ARM template for resource provisioning.
  - A sample GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD (build, push, deploy).
  - Documentation for manual deployment steps.

I’ll begin by scaffolding the `azure-deploy/` directory and a README with the deployment overview.

Your Azure deployment scaffolding is ready!  
You now have:

- `azure-deploy/main.bicep` — deploys ACR, Web Apps (backend/frontend), and PostgreSQL.
- `azure-deploy/sample.env` — example environment variables for Azure.
- `azure-deploy/github-actions-sample.yml` — sample CI/CD workflow.
- `azure-deploy/README.md` — step-by-step deployment guide.

Next steps:
1. Build and push your Docker images to ACR.
2. Deploy resources with the Bicep template.
3. Configure your Web Apps to use the images and set environment variables.

Let me know if you want detailed CLI commands for each step, or help with any specific part of the process!

Let's proceed step by step to deploy your solution to Azure Web App for Containers. Here’s what we’ll do next:

1. Build and Push Docker Images to Azure Container Registry (ACR)
a. Create an Azure Container Registry (if you don’t have one)
b. Log in to ACR
c. Build and push backend image
d. Build and push frontend image
2. Deploy Azure Resources with Bicep
a. Log in to Azure
b. Deploy the Bicep template
3. Configure Web Apps
In the Azure Portal, go to your backend and frontend Web Apps.
Set the container image to the one you pushed (<your-acr-name>.azurecr.io/uknf-backend:latest and <your-acr-name>.azurecr.io/uknf-frontend:latest).
Set environment variables as per sample.env (update connection strings, JWT secrets, etc).
4. (Optional) Set Up CI/CD
Use the provided github-actions-sample.yml as a template for GitHub Actions.
Would you like me to generate a ready-to-run PowerShell script for these steps, or do you want to proceed manually? If you want a script, please provide your Azure resource group name, ACR name, and desired app names.
