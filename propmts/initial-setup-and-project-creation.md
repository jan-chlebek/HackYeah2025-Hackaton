I need to create a project using Angular and using .NET and PostgreSQL. Use specifications from files
- .requirements/DETAILS_UKNF_Prompt2Code2.md
- .requirements/RULES_UKNF_Prompt2Code2.md

Use what you are most proficient at and is most suitable for a hackathon project. Use PostgreSQL instead of MSSQL.
Prepare setup scripts for installing dependencies for Arch Linux and Windows and a script to create project.
