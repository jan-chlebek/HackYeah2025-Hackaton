## Technical Details

### Fixed Issues:
1. **Pagination NaN Bug** - Fixed in announcements
   - Problem: PrimeNG sends `event.first` but code was using `event.page`
   - Solution: Calculate page from first: `const page = Math.floor(this.first / this.pageSize) + 1;`
   - Result: Announcements now load correctly with page=1

### Code Patterns:
- All components use Angular 20 standalone components
- PrimeNG for UI components
- Reactive patterns with RxJS
- Polish locale (pl-PL) for dates and labels
- High contrast mode support
- WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility compliance
