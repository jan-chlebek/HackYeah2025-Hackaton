# Good Prompt Examples and Use Cases

This chapter showcases real-world examples of effective prompts used during the development of this project. Each example demonstrates best practices and lessons learned.

## üìö Use Case 1: Writing Documentation

**Reference:** `Documentation-2025-10-05_070734.md`

### The Prompt
```
In this file, add recommendation for used model. Say that newer is basically better - and link Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5 codex. Bring their release dates.

Say that Claude works better to iterate faster and work on smaller features, GPT takes time as a reasoning model, but after that the code is more integrated with current structure and better thought out.
```

### Why It's Effective ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

1. **Clear Context:** Specifies which file to modify
2. **Specific Requirements:** Lists exact information to include (release dates, links)
3. **Source Reference:** Provides URL for graphics and attribution
4. **Comparative Analysis:** Asks for comparison between two models with specific characteristics
5. **Practical Guidance:** Requests actionable recommendations

### What It Produced
- Comprehensive AI model recommendation section
- Release dates for both models
- Strengths and weaknesses comparison
- Decision matrix table for when to use each model
- Proper attribution to Anthropic

### Key Takeaway
When writing documentation, provide context, sources, and the specific angle you want the content to take.

## üé® Use Case 2: Generating Diagrams

**Reference:** `Documentation-2025-10-05_075231.md`

### The Prompt
```
I want to use this chapter to list good prompting practices. I want to mention that prompts should be feature oriented and code result should be always reviewed by developer. There are two types of developers with AI - the ones who read and optimize code and the ones who doesn't read and pray.

Prompts should be always written in english as it's primary internet language

Create an excalidraw diagram that should demonstrate human in the loop process. For example when creating requirements file, model was prompted 3 times before checking the output if something important was not missed
```

### Why It's Effective ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

1. **Content Goals:** Clearly states what concepts to include
2. **Specific Tool:** Requests Excalidraw (not just "a diagram")
3. **Concrete Example:** Gives a real scenario (requirements file, 3 iterations)
4. **Conceptual Framework:** Explains the human-in-the-loop process
5. **Context First:** Explains the purpose before the diagram request

### Follow-up Prompts (Also Effective)
```
Texts are still not visible
```
Simple, direct problem statement that led to proper fix.

```
Add arrow between Human Review and prompt 2 - repeat N-times to ensure consistency
```
Specific connection points and label text.

```
Can you make all texts XL size?
```
Clear, actionable request.

### What It Produced
- Excalidraw diagram with proper structure
- PNG export for documentation
- Iterative refinements through multiple prompts
- Visual representation of abstract concept

### Key Takeaway
For diagrams: Specify the tool, give concrete examples, and iterate incrementally with simple, direct follow-up prompts.

## üñ•Ô∏è Use Case 3: Fixing UI Issues on Frontend

**Reference:** `Frontend-updates-2025-01-04_accessibility.md`

### The Prompts (Progressive Refinement)

#### Prompt 1: Layout Fix
```
Login component should not be overflowing on desktop. Make it better.
```
**Effectiveness:** 
Simple problem statement. AI improved layout with modern CSS.

#### Prompt 2: Dark Mode Implementation
```
Please implement dark mode support for this screen. Focus on my request. Make it similar to other sites
```
**Effectiveness:**  
Clear feature request with reference to industry standards.

#### Prompt 3: Debugging
```
Darkmode toggle does not apply implemented styles. This toggle is on header
```
**Effectiveness:**
Problem statement + context about where the control is located. Led to proper solution using `:host-context()`.

#### Prompt 4: Mobile Accessibility
```
Accessibility buttons on login screen are not visible on mobile
```
**Effectiveness:**   
Simple problem statement. AI created comprehensive solution with FAB (Floating Action Button).

#### Prompt 5: Responsive Design
```
This floating option should be only visible on mobile interfaces
```
**Effectiveness:**   
Specific requirement. AI implemented proper media queries.

#### Prompt 6: State Synchronization
```
Font size accessibility option should be synchronized between mobile and desktop interface selectors
```
**Effectiveness:**   
Identified architecture issue. Led to creation of centralized `AccessibilityService`.

### Why This Sequence Is Effective

1. **Incremental Approach:** Each prompt builds on previous work
2. **Clear Problem Statements:** No ambiguity about what's wrong
3. **Context Provided:** Mentions where controls are located
4. **Progressive Enhancement:** Started simple, added complexity
5. **Testing Feedback:** Used real observations to guide improvements

### What It Produced
- Responsive login layout
- Complete dark mode implementation
- Mobile-optimized accessibility controls
- Centralized accessibility service
- Synchronized state across components
- Comprehensive documentation

### Key Takeaway
For UI work: Start with simple problem statements, provide context about user interactions, and iterate based on testing observations.

## üé® Use Case 4: Implementing High-Contrast Accessibility

**Reference:** `FrontendNG-2025-10-05_033623.md`

### The Prompts

#### Prompt 1: Color Scheme
```
High contrast mode should have black background, yellow text and yellow borders
```
**Effectiveness:**   
Crystal clear specification of color requirements.

#### Prompt 2: Coverage
```
More elements should be black. Currently half of the interface is white
```
**Effectiveness:**   
Observation-based feedback that led to comprehensive overrides.

### Why These Are Effective

1. **Specific Colors:** Named exact colors (black, yellow)
2. **Visual Feedback:** Reported what was observed ("half is white")
3. **Clear Requirements:** No ambiguity about desired outcome
4. **Testable:** Easy to verify if requirements are met

### What It Produced
- Complete high-contrast mode implementation
- WCAG AAA compliance (19.56:1 contrast ratio)
- Comprehensive PrimeNG component overrides
- Coverage for all UI elements (tables, forms, dialogs, navigation)
- Documentation of color scheme and rationale

### Key Takeaway
For accessibility: Be specific about colors and contrast, provide visual feedback from testing, and iterate until comprehensive coverage is achieved.

## üìã Common Patterns in Effective Prompts

### 1. **Context ‚Üí Task ‚Üí Expectations**
```
[Context] In the login component,
[Task] implement dark mode support
[Expectations] using colors similar to other sites
```

### 2. **Problem Statement ‚Üí Location ‚Üí Expected Fix**
```
[Problem] Accessibility buttons are not visible
[Location] on login screen
[Expected Fix] on mobile
```

### 3. **Feature Request ‚Üí Specification ‚Üí Example**
```
[Feature] Create an excalidraw diagram
[Specification] demonstrating human-in-the-loop process
[Example] like when creating requirements file with 3 iterations
```

### 4. **Observation ‚Üí Issue ‚Üí Improvement**
```
[Observation] Currently half of the interface is white
[Issue] More elements should be black
[Improvement] in high contrast mode
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ‚ùå Too Vague
```
Make it better
Fix the UI
Add some documentation
```

### ‚úÖ Better Versions
```
Login component should not overflow on desktop. Use modern CSS with clamp() for responsive padding.
Implement dark mode support for this screen using :host-context() for Angular components.
Add documentation about AI model selection with comparison table and release dates.
```

### ‚ùå No Context
```
It doesn't work
The colors are wrong
Add a service
```

### ‚úÖ Better Versions
```
Dark mode toggle in header doesn't apply styles to login component
High contrast mode should use black background with yellow text, currently half is white
Create AccessibilityService to synchronize font size between login and dashboard components
```
