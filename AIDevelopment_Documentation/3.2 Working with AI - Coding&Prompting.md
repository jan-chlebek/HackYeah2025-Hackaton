3.2. Project Initialization – Predictable Setup

**Principle:** Every project should start with a predictable, repeatable setup. Before a resource can be published, it must meet minimum requirements:
- Frontend from a proven template
- Backend from a proven template
- At least one working endpoint
- Dockerization + helper scripts - enabling the entire environment to run with a single command (vibecoded)

### 3.2.1. Frontend - Angular from Template

**Install Angular CLI globally:**
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

**Create a new project:**
```bash
ng new uknf-project
```

During initialization, Angular CLI will ask about:
- Routing (whether to add Angular Router) - We selected Yes
- Style format (CSS, SCSS, SASS, LESS) - CSS (Tailwind documentation recommendation)

**Start the development server:**
```bash
cd frontend/uknf-project
ng serve
```

The application will be available by default at: `http://localhost:4200`


### 3.2.2. Backend - .NET from Template

**Install .NET SDK:**
```bash
# Windows (Chocolatey)
choco install dotnet-9.0-sdk


**Create Web API project:**
```bash
dotnet new webapi -n UknfCommunicationPlatform.Api
cd backend/UknfCommunicationPlatform.Api
```

The API will be available by default at:
- HTTPS: `https://localhost:7000`
- HTTP: `http://localhost:5000`
- Swagger UI: `https://localhost:7000/swagger`


### 3.2.3. First Working Endpoint

**Minimal health check endpoint:**

```csharp
// Program.cs
app.MapGet("/health", () => "Healthy")
.WithName("HealthCheck")
.WithTags("System");
```


### 3.2.4. Dockerization – Everything in One Command

**Docker structure:**
```
project-root/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── docker-compose.dev.yml
├── frontend/
│   └── Dockerfile
└── backend/
    └── Dockerfile
```

**Helper scripts:**

`dev-start.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Starting development environment..."
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

`dev-stop.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Stopping development environment..."
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
```

**Docker environment verification:**
```bash
# Check running containers
docker-compose ps

# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f backend
docker-compose logs -f frontend

# Check health check
curl http://localhost:8080/health
# Expected response: Healthy
```

**AI prompt for dockerization:**
```
"Create complete Docker configuration for the project:
- docker-compose.yml for production
- docker-compose.dev.yml for development with hot-reload
- Dockerfile for ASP.NET Core 9 (multi-stage build)
- Dockerfile for Angular 20 with nginx
- PostgreSQL 16 with health check
- Volumes for data persistence
- Environment variables in .env
- Startup scripts dev-start.sh and dev-stop.sh
- Nginx configuration for Angular SPA (routing support)
- Health check endpoints for all services
- Networking between containers
- README.md with startup instructions"
```

### 3.2.5. Publication Checklist

Before publishing the project, ensure that:

**Frontend:**
- [ ] Project initializes without errors (`ng new`)
- [ ] Development server starts (`ng serve`)
- [ ] Application opens in browser (localhost:4200)
- [ ] No errors in browser console
- [ ] No ESLint/TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] Dockerfile builds correctly
- [ ] Production build works (`ng build --configuration production`)

**Backend:**
- [ ] Project compiles without errors (`dotnet build`)
- [ ] API starts (`dotnet run`)
- [ ] Swagger UI is accessible
- [ ] Endpoint /api/health returns response
- [ ] Unit tests pass (`dotnet test`)
- [ ] Dockerfile builds correctly
- [ ] Database connection works

**Docker:**
- [ ] `docker-compose up` starts all services
- [ ] Backend is accessible via localhost:8080
- [ ] Frontend is accessible via localhost:80
- [ ] Database initializes correctly
- [ ] Health checks for all services return OK
- [ ] Volumes preserve data after restart
- [ ] Logs are readable and show no errors


### 3.2.6. Best Practices - Lessons Learned

**Recommendations:**
1. **Version your templates** - keep working templates in a separate repo
2. **Automate** - `init-project.sh` scripts for repeatability
3. **Document from the start** - README first, code later
4. **Health checks everywhere** - every service must have a /health endpoint
5. **Environment variables** - never hardcode credentials
6. **Docker first** - if it doesn't work in Docker, don't publish
7. **Smoke tests** - minimal tests before each commit

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- ❌ Publishing a project without a working endpoint
- ❌ No dockerization ("it works on my machine")
- ❌ Credentials in code
- ❌ No README with startup instructions
- ❌ Untested Dockerfile
- ❌ No health check endpoints
- ❌ Non-working docker-compose
- ❌ AI instructions not prepared and applied before real development start
