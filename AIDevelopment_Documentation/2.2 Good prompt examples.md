## üé® Use Case 2: Generating Diagrams

**Reference:** `Documentation-2025-10-05_075231.md`

### The Prompt
```
I want to use this chapter to list good prompting practices. I want to mention that prompts should be feature oriented and code result should be always reviewed by developer. There are two types of developers with AI - the ones who read and optimize code and the ones who doesn't read and pray.

Prompts should be always written in english as it's primary internet language

Create an excalidraw diagram that should demonstrate human in the loop process. For example when creating requirements file, model was prompted 3 times before checking the output if something important was not missed
```

### Why It's Effective ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

1. **Content Goals:** Clearly states what concepts to include
2. **Specific Tool:** Requests Excalidraw (not just "a diagram")
3. **Concrete Example:** Gives a real scenario (requirements file, 3 iterations)
4. **Conceptual Framework:** Explains the human-in-the-loop process
5. **Context First:** Explains the purpose before the diagram request

### Follow-up Prompts (Also Effective)
```
Texts are still not visible
```
Simple, direct problem statement that led to proper fix.

```
Add arrow between Human Review and prompt 2 - repeat N-times to ensure consistency
```
Specific connection points and label text.

```
Can you make all texts XL size?
```
Clear, actionable request.

### What It Produced
- Excalidraw diagram with proper structure
- PNG export for documentation
- Iterative refinements through multiple prompts
- Visual representation of abstract concept

### Key Takeaway
For diagrams: Specify the tool, give concrete examples, and iterate incrementally with simple, direct follow-up prompts.

## üé® Use Case 4: Implementing High-Contrast Accessibility

**Reference:** `FrontendNG-2025-10-05_033623.md`

### The Prompts

#### Prompt 1: Color Scheme
```
High contrast mode should have black background, yellow text and yellow borders
```
**Effectiveness:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  
Crystal clear specification of color requirements.

#### Prompt 2: Coverage
```
More elements should be black. Currently half of the interface is white
```
**Effectiveness:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  
Observation-based feedback that led to comprehensive overrides.

### Why These Are Effective

1. **Specific Colors:** Named exact colors (black, yellow)

## üìã Common Patterns in Effective Prompts

### 1. **Context ‚Üí Task ‚Üí Expectations**
```
[Context] In the login component,
[Task] implement dark mode support
[Expectations] using colors similar to other sites
```

### 2. **Problem Statement ‚Üí Location ‚Üí Expected Fix**
```
[Problem] Accessibility buttons are not visible
[Location] on login screen
[Expected Fix] on mobile
```

### 3. **Feature Request ‚Üí Specification ‚Üí Example**
```
[Feature] Create an excalidraw diagram
[Specification] demonstrating human-in-the-loop process
[Example] like when creating requirements file with 3 iterations
```

### 4. **Observation ‚Üí Issue ‚Üí Improvement**
```
[Observation] Currently half of the interface is white
[Issue] More elements should be black
[Improvement] in high contrast mode
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ‚ùå Too Vague
```
Make it better
Fix the UI
Add some documentation
```

> [!CAUTION]
> AI is especailly bad in backened development. Implement as small features as possible!

### ‚úÖ Better Versions
```
Login component should not overflow on desktop. Use modern CSS with clamp() for responsive padding.
Implement dark mode support for this screen using :host-context() for Angular components.
Add documentation about AI model selection with comparison table and release dates.
```

### ‚ùå No Context
```
It doesn't work
The colors are wrong
Add a service
```

### ‚úÖ Better Versions
```
Dark mode toggle in header doesn't apply styles to login component
High contrast mode should use black background with yellow text, currently half is white
Create AccessibilityService to synchronize font size between login and dashboard components
```
